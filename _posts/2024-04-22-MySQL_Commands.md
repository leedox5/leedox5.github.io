## 1. **SELECT**

The `SELECT` command is the cornerstone of MySQL queries, allowing you to retrieve data from tables based on specified criteria. By specifying the columns you want to retrieve and using optional clauses like `WHERE` for filtering, you can get the exact data you need.

- **Example**: Retrieve the name and age of all employees:
    ```sql
    SELECT name, age FROM employees;
    ```

## 2. **INSERT**

The `INSERT` command lets you add new rows of data into a table. This command can be used to insert a single row or multiple rows at once.

- **Example**: Add a new employee to the `employees` table:
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO employees (name, age, department)
    VALUES ('John Doe', 30, 'Marketing');
    ```

## 3. **UPDATE**

The `UPDATE` command allows you to modify existing rows in a table. By specifying the columns and new values, along with a `WHERE` clause for targeting specific rows, you can update data efficiently.

- **Example**: Update the age of an employee with a specific ID:
    ```sql
    UPDATE employees
    SET age = 31
    WHERE employee_id = 1;
    ```

## 4. **DELETE**

The `DELETE` command removes rows from a table based on specified conditions. Always use a `WHERE` clause to avoid accidentally deleting all rows from a table.

- **Example**: Remove an employee with a specific ID:
    ```sql
    DELETE FROM employees
    WHERE employee_id = 2;
    ```

## 5. **JOIN**

The `JOIN` command allows you to combine data from two or more tables based on a related column. There are different types of joins, including `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and `RIGHT JOIN`, each serving a different purpose.

- **Example**: Retrieve employees' names and their department names using an `INNER JOIN` between `employees` and `departments` tables:
    ```sql
    SELECT e.name, d.department_name
    FROM employees e
    JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
    ```

By mastering these five essential MySQL commands, you can efficiently manage and manipulate data in your applications. These commands form the foundation of working with MySQL, helping you build powerful, data-driven applications with ease.
